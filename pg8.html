        <p>While walking around the castle, you find a back entrance for you to enter. Running down these stairs, you find that they take you straight to the dragon's lair.</p>
        <p>Shockingly, however, the dragon begins to speak to you. It says that a wizard is the one who put this curse on it to control her, and needs you to free her!</p>
