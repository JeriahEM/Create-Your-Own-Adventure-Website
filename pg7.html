    <div class="box">
        <p>With your sword and shield, you battle the guards standing at the front gate... and emerge victorious!</p>
        <p>You pull a lever, and the gate lowers, revealing a stone staircase that leads into the castle.</p>
        <p>Finally inside, you discover what you have been looking for... The dragon.</p>
        <p>Shockingly, however, the dragon begins to speak to you. It says that a wizard is the one who put this curse on it to control her, and needs you to free her!</p>

        <p>What will you do now?</p>

        <p>Or</p>
        <a href="./pg10.html">Do not trust the dragon and slay it.</a>
