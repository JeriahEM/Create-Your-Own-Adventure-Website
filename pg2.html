        <p>The Great Wizard will join you on your quest.</p>
        <p>When he meets you, he says;</p>
        <p>â€œYou have come to visit me, knight and it seems that you have embarked on a quest. Well then let me tell you about an old fable that I heard long ago. Long ago there was this wizard who wanted more power. He seeked forgotten and forbidden knowledge for this power but soon realized the ultimate power was a curse that turned a human into a dragon. The wizard did not want to lose his humanity and become nothing more than a beast so he gave up. Recently I heard that the same wizard from the fable lives on a castle in the western valley of this kingdom."</p>
